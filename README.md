Hello Everybody!

This my Andrew's website: a fun place to list my work, activities, and thoughts on a single, concrete platform.  
All code used on this site is either developed by me or pulled from free, public learning tools.  This site by no means is used for monetary or commercial improvement, but rather my fun side project to talk about myself. 

- Andrew
